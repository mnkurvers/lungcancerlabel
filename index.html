							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>Why Lung Cancer Awareness?</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>In January 2019, my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer. He lives a healthy lifestyle and has never been a smoker. Like many families that are hit with a cancer diagnoses, especially when a never-smoker is diagnosed with lung cancer, we were shocked. This news opened our eyes to the impact of this deadly and common cancer.</p>
							<p>The reason that I chose lung cancer awareness for my capstone is because lung cancer is a very real health issue in the world. It was important to me to choose a topic that (1) I am passionate about and (2) is a real world problem that can be challenged with design.  I am using my undergraduate and masters course knowledge to complete the capstone, I believe this is the whole idea of a capstone.</p>

							<h2>Challenge</h2>
							<p>Lung Cancer Awareness in the U.S.</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women in the United States of America. Though more die of lung cancer than colon and breast cancers combined, lung cancer receives less research dollars. Part of the problem is the stigma that this cancer carries, “you have to smoke to get lung cancer.” This is untrue, in fact, anyone can get lung cancer.</p>

							<p>The challenge presented is a lack of understanding and awareness of lung cancer by society. I want to create a data and story-driven integrated digital marketing campaign to grab attention and raise awareness about lung cancer, its stigma and the inequity in funding related to its mortality rate.</p>

							<h2>Process</h2>
							<p>Understanding The Topic</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>I started with some front-end research on the ABOH website and set up an introductory meeting with Nancy Torrigan,ABOH Executive Director. I then absorbed and organized my notes from the initial research, meeting, and deeper dive. Brooke Miller, the ABOH Director of Marketing and Communications met with me to talk about her experiences and the challenge of awareness marketing.

							After my first two meetings, I had so much information that I struggled to narrow down my key message. Since there are so many messages within that deserve attention, it was hard to choose one specifically. I wrote a first draft of my campaign brief and sent to Nancy and Brooke for their review and then had a working session with Nancy to fix any wording and messaging issues. We narrowed it to a clearer two-part message of research dollars and early detection. 

							When I started writing the brand identity for the campaign, I wondered if I was making it too light hearted, by wanting to use fun colors and “trendy” design. I ran this by Nancy and gave her the reasoning(that I want the message to reach the audience and I think good, fun, trendy design can help), and she loved the idea. 

							My most recent step in the process was creating mood boards and starting the sketching process for a logo. Part of me feels a bit behind because I am only just starting in the design phase, however, I had a lot of messaging to get straight and lay the ground work for the concept that I came up with through that research and message development: The Lung Cancer Label. </p>
